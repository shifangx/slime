"""Nemotron 3.5 Super VL (HF ``model_type: nemotron_h_omni``) as a ``--spec`` target.

Used from ``scripts/models/nemotron-3.5-super-vl-120b-a12b.sh``::

    --spec "slime_plugins.models.nemotron_35_super_vl" "get_nemotron_35_super_vl_model_provider"

WHAT THIS FILE IS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT
--------------------------------------------------
The language tower is Nemotron-3 Super's, unchanged. That is not an assumption:
mapped onto megatron's ``M``/``E``/``*`` alphabet, the 88-entry
``llm_config.layers_block_type`` of this checkpoint is character-for-character
equal to Nemotron-3 Super's ``hybrid_override_pattern``, and of every key the
two language configs share exactly one value differs (``eos_token_id``). So the
tower here is built by *calling* ``nemotron_h.get_nemotron_h_spec``, not by
copying it -- which is also what inherits its ``loss_mask`` subclass and its
three ``_assert_supported`` guards instead of re-deriving them.

**The vision tower is the checkpoint's own Transformers module, replicated
across tensor-parallel ranks, not megatron.core's ``RADIOViTModel``.** Three
reasons, in order of weight:

1. ``megatron/core/models/vision/radio.py`` at slime's Megatron pin is an older
   revision whose ``forward()`` takes no ``packed_seq_params``, and slime's VLM
   path builds packed sequences unconditionally. Using it means vendoring a
   newer ``radio.py`` *and* re-deriving its weight map.
2. The tower is **frozen**, so the tensor-parallel sharding megatron would buy
   is worth nothing. Replicated, it is ~0.7 B parameters -- 1.4 GB per rank in
   BF16, against 180 GB of B200.
3. Dropping the 10 class/register tokens, the 2x2 pixel shuffle and the ``mlp1``
   projector all already exist, written and released with the checkpoint, in
   ``NemotronH_Omni_Reasoning_V3VisionProjector``. Porting them by hand is three
   opportunities to get a spatial rearrangement subtly wrong for no gain.

``qwen3_5_vl.py`` makes the same trade for the same reasons, so this is the
established shape in this tree rather than an invention. What is left to write
is the scatter of image features onto ``<image>`` placeholders, and that is
``qwen3_5_vl.py``'s ``_inject_vision_embeddings`` with the mrope half deleted --
this model is NoPE.

Verified against the checkpoint at
``nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-Super-120B-A12B-SourceOfTruth`` and megatron.core
0.16.0rc0.

    ----------------------------------------------------
    It has a list branch -- ``torch.cat([self.forward(pv, ...) for pv in ...])``
    -- but that branch cannot serve this processor. Two things are wrong with it
    here, and both come from dynamic resolution:

    * the elements the image processor puts in the list are ``(3, H, W)``, and
      ``forward`` immediately does ``_, _, H, W = pixel_values.shape``, which
      needs four dimensions;
    * even given four, each image projects to ``(1, tokens_i, hidden)`` with a
      *different* ``tokens_i``, and ``torch.cat(..., dim=0)`` on those raises.

    So the list is iterated here instead, each image is projected on its own and
    flattened, and the results concatenate on the token axis. That is also the
    shape the placeholder scatter needs: one row per ``<image>`` token, in image
    order. A stacked ``(N, 3, H, W)`` tensor -- what the processor returns when
    every image in the sample happens to be the same size -- takes the same path
    through the projector's own batch dimension and flattens to the same thing.

    The tower is frozen, but the projector is not, so this is deliberately not
    wrapped in ``torch.no_grad()``: the gradient has to reach ``mlp1``.
