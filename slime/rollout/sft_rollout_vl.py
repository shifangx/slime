"""SFT rollout for vision-language models.

`sft_rollout.py` is text only: it loads a processor at module level and never
uses it, so tokens come from `MultiTurnLossMaskGenerator.get_loss_mask`, nothing
populates `Sample.multimodal_inputs`/`multimodal_train_inputs`, and a VL model
pointed at it trains on text-only batches while looking perfectly healthy. That
is why no SFT script in this repo sources a `-vl` model config.

This module is that file with the processor actually used. The pieces it needs
already existed and were simply unwired:

* `Dataset` builds `Sample.multimodal_inputs` for every row whenever
  `--multimodal-keys` is set (`slime/utils/data.py`), the same way the RL path
  gets its images -- nothing there is specific to generation;
* `MultiTurnLossMaskGenerator.get_loss_mask_with_multimodal_alignment`
  (`slime/utils/mask_utils.py`) takes `input_ids` as an *input* rather than
  producing them, i.e. it was written for a caller that has already run the
  processor over text + images. Before this module there was no such caller
  anywhere in the tree;
* `RolloutManager` forwards `Sample.multimodal_train_inputs` to the trainer
  whenever any sample carries it (`slime/ray/rollout.py`), the megatron backend
  concatenates the per-sample tensors and passes them as forward kwargs, and
  `slime_plugins/models/qwen3_5_vl.py` consumes them.

So the only new code is the encode step in the middle, and it is deliberately
kept in one pure function -- `encode_multimodal_sample` -- so it can be tested
without Ray, a data buffer or a GPU.

Use it exactly like the text one, with the multimodal flags the RL path already
passes:

    --rollout-function-path slime.rollout.sft_rollout_vl.generate_rollout \
    --input-key messages \
    --multimodal-keys '{"image": "images"}' \
    --loss-type sft_loss --loss-mask-type qwen3_5 \
    --calculate-per-token-loss --disable-compute-advantages-and-returns \
    --debug-train-only

Do **not** pass `--apply-chat-template`: it renders the prompt to a string at
dataset construction, and both this module and `sft_rollout.py` need the message
list. `--multimodal-keys` alone is enough to get the conversation form.

Rows without images fall back to the text path, so this module is a superset of
`sft_rollout.py` and a mixed dataset trains correctly.

    Two details carry the correctness of the whole module:

    ``add_generation_prompt=False``
        SFT trains *on* the assistant turn, so it has to be inside the rendered
        text. `get_loss_mask` renders the same way for its text projection, so
        the two sequences agree everywhere outside the vision span.

    the alignment is a left-pad
        `get_loss_mask_with_multimodal_alignment` computes the mask on the
        text-only projection of `messages` and prepends
        ``len(input_ids) - len(text_mask)`` zeros. That is correct exactly when
        every token the processor added sits before the first trainable token --
        true for the usual shape of an image in a user turn followed by an
        assistant turn, and not a general guarantee. Verify it by decoding the
        mask back with `MultiTurnLossMaskGenerator.get_text_from_loss_mask`: it
        must return the assistant turn and nothing else. `prepare_sft_dataset.py`
        in the sft_vlm_geo3k_qwen3.5 scripts does exactly that, before a node is
