"""HuggingFace ``nemotron_h`` -> Megatron ``MambaModel`` weight mapping.

The loader contract is one function (``common.py::load_model_hf_weights``):
given a *Megatron* parameter name, return the full, unsharded tensor it should
hold. The caller then does vocab padding, tensor-parallel sharding and the shape
check. So this file is a name map plus exactly one real transform (QKV fusion).

The model it maps onto is ``slime_plugins.models.nemotron_h``, which builds
megatron.core's generic hybrid stack -- 88 layers of Mamba-2 / attention /
latent MoE for Nemotron-3 Super, and the same file unchanged for the Nano and
Ultra configs, which differ only in arguments.

WHERE THE MAP COMES FROM
------------------------
Not from reading the two implementations side by side. Megatron-Bridge carries a
verified bidirectional mapping for this architecture
(``src/megatron/bridge/models/nemotronh/nemotron_h_bridge.py::mapping_registry``)
and it is what converted this checkpoint independently. Every entry below is the
Megatron-side name of one of its mappings, restricted to the subset
``MambaModel`` actually creates. Two of its groups are dropped:

* **MTP.** The released checkpoints ship a Multi-Token-Prediction block
  (``mtp.layers.0.*``, 512 more experts). ``MambaModel`` has no MTP, so those
  names are never requested and the tensors are not read. A model loaded through
  here is the backbone without its speculative-decoding head, which matters for
  inference throughput and not for training.
* **Quantisation-spec aliases** (``decoder.layers.*.input_layernorm.weight`` and
  friends). The stock ``mamba_stack_spec`` fuses every input norm into the
  following TE linear, so only the fused names occur. The unfused aliases are
  still handled below, because they cost one dict entry and their absence would
  otherwise surface as a ``KeyError`` on some future spec.

TENSOR PARALLELISM
------------------
This loader refuses TP > 1 and ETP > 1, on purpose. Three separate things in the
generic sharding path are wrong for this model at TP > 1:

1. ``_tensor_parallel_shard`` special-cases any ``linear_fc1.weight`` as a fused
   gate+up tensor and splits it in halves first. Nemotron's experts are
   **squared-ReLU, not gated** -- there is no gate half -- so that split silently
   interleaves garbage. It hits the shared expert at TP and the routed experts at
   ETP.
2. Mamba ``in_proj`` is the concatenation ``[z, x, B, C, dt]``, and Megatron
   expects each TP rank to hold a slice of *every* component, not a contiguous
   block of the whole. A naive chunk gives rank 0 all of ``z`` and nothing else.
3. ``conv1d`` has the same problem over ``[x, B, C]``.

Fixing those three in ``common.py`` -- by discriminating ungated MLPs on
``config.gated_linear_unit`` rather than on the parameter name, and by slicing
the two Mamba tensors per component -- is what would lift this restriction and
let ``--load`` point straight at an HF snapshot at any TP. Until then the
supported route is ``tools/convert_hf_to_torch_dist.py`` at TP1/ETP1/EP1 once,
after which megatron.core's own dist-checkpoint reader reshards to any TP/EP
correctly, because ``MambaMixer`` and the MoE modules implement
``sharded_state_dict``. Converting once is also cheaper: the HF side of
Nemotron-3 Super is 42,683 separate tensors.
