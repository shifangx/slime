"""Megatron -> HuggingFace name mapping for Nemotron 3.5 Super VL (``nemotron_h_omni``).

The inverse of hf_to_megatron/nemotron_h_vl.py, and a dispatcher for the same
reason: the decoder is the Nemotron-H stack ``nemotron_h.py`` already converts,
and all this file owns is the prefix the omni checkpoint puts in front of it
plus the vision keys.

    vision_model.<anything>                     see _VISION_RENAMES
    vision_projector.mlp1.norm.weight           mlp1.0.weight
    vision_projector.mlp1.linear1.weight        mlp1.1.weight
    vision_projector.mlp1.linear2.weight        mlp1.3.weight
    vision_projector.vision_final_layernorm.*   vision_projector.vision_final_layernorm.*

Why the released checkpoint's key set is the target
---------------------------------------------------
GRPO pushes these tensors into the colocated SGLang engine before every rollout.
The engine is ``NemotronH_Omni_Reasoning_V3`` (models/nano_nemotron_vl.py), and
its ``load_weights`` routes purely by prefix:

    language_model.*                  -> the LLM, prefix stripped
    mlp1.*                            -> the projector nn.Sequential, by index
    vision_model.radio_model.*        -> the RADIO tower, `vision_model.` stripped
    vision_projector.vision_final_layernorm.*  -> the Super-only LayerNorm

which is exactly the naming of the released checkpoint, because cold start loads
that checkpoint through this very method. So "emit the checkpoint's own keys" is
not a convention adopted here -- it is the requirement, and it is verifiable
against model.safetensors.index.json rather than inferred.

This cuts both ways, and it is the thing to be careful about. That routing has
**no else branch**: a name matching none of the four prefixes is dropped on the
floor, and the tower's own loader (models/radio.py) likewise skips any key it
cannot find in ``named_parameters()``. Getting a name wrong here therefore does
not raise. It produces an engine running partly stale weights and a quietly
wrong ``train_rollout_logprob_abs_diff``, which is why every line below is
pinned to a checkpoint key or to a named sglang parameter.

Two places where this is more than a rename
-------------------------------------------
  * **Fused qkv.** RadioModel spells attention as three Linears
    (``attention.attention.{query,key,value}``); the checkpoint and sglang both
    want one ``attn.qkv``. The load direction splits it with ``Chunk(dim=0)``
    (modeling_radio.py:64-72), so the inverse is ``cat([q, k, v], dim=0)`` -- but
    the three arrive as three separate calls, so they are buffered until the
    triple is complete and emitted as one tensor on the third. sglang's
    ``QKVParallelLinear`` weight loader is invoked as ``weight_loader(param, w)``
    with no shard id (models/radio.py:598), i.e. it only accepts the fused form;
    emitting q/k/v separately would hit the silent-drop path above.

  * **LayerScale.** ``encoder.layer.{i}.layer_scale{1,2}.lambda1`` has no
    checkpoint counterpart at all -- C-RADIO ViT-H ships no layerscale, and the
    load direction synthesises it as ``layerscale_value * ones`` precisely
    because it is absent. But it *is* an nn.Parameter on both sides (this tower
    is not frozen in the GRPO recipe, so it trains), and sglang's layer does
    carry one, as ``ls1``/``ls2`` (models/internvl.py:249-250). So these map to
    ``...blocks.{i}.ls{1,2}``, which is the one target below that is a named
    sglang parameter rather than a checkpoint key. Dropping them instead would
    leave the engine on the init value and diverge from the trainer as soon as
    the first optimizer step moved them.

Buffers -- ``input_conditioner.norm_{mean,std}`` and ``summary_idxs`` -- are not
parameters, and the weight sync only walks ``named_parameters()`` plus
``expert_bias`` (update_weight/common.py:147-190), so they never reach here.
``make_preprocessor_external()`` has replaced the input conditioner with an
nn.Identity anyway (modeling_radio.py:477).
